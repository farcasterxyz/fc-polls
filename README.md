# Farcaster Frames Poll app

An example Poll app using [Farcaster Frames](https://warpcast.notion.site/Farcaster-Frames-4bd47fe97dc74a42a48d3a234636d8c5). 

This example lets you create a poll and have users vote on it. The FrameAction is authenticated against a hub 
so the votes cannot be spoofed (if `HUB_URL` is provided), and the results are stored in a redis database.
